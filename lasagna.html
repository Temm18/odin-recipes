    <h1>Grandma's Best Ever Sour Cream Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="/home/timmaassen/repos/odin-recipes/images/Lasagna.jpg">
    <p>This is my grandma's best lasagna recipe, except I use sour cream instead of ricotta (a trick I picked up from my mother-in-law). 
        <br>She always made it for birthdays and special occasions. This makes a large amount, 
        so I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. 
        <br>It's very cheesy, so sometimes I add a little extra tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>    
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat, 
                <br>stirring occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. 
                <br>Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, 
                <br>stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <P>When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                <br>Add lasagna noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                <br>until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Stir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella, Parmesan, olives, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                <br>Cover with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, and 1/3 of the cheese mixture; 
                <br>repeat layers two more times with remaining noodles, sauce, and cheese mixture. 
                <br>Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
