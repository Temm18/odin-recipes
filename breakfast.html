    <h1>Italan Breakfast Strata</h1>
    <img src="images/italian-breakfast-strata.jpg">
    <p>Chef John's Italian breakfast strata is one of the best breakfast casseroles ever, layered with Italian bread cubes, 
        <br>Italian sausage, plenty of spinach, and melty fontina cheese in just the right amount of egg custard. 
        <br>It has a fantastic fluffy texture, rich and satisfying, and yet somehow not heavy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large loaf Italian or French bread</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil plus more to grease baking dish</li>
        <li>12 ounces italian sausage, casings removed</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound baby spinach</li>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>8 ounces fontina or fontal cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Cut bread into 1-inch cubes, and spread out in a single layer on the work surface; 
                <br>leave uncovered overnight to become stale.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Add olive oil to a skillet set over medium-high heat, and add sausage. 
                <br>Cook, while crumbling with a spatula, for a few minutes, just until the sausage starts to brown. 
                <br>Add onions, a large pinch of salt, black pepper, cayenne, oregano, thyme, and rosemary. 
                <br>Cook, stirring until the onions soften and start to turn translucent.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Transfer the mixture into a bowl, then spoon about 1 tablespoon of rendered sausage fat back into the pan; 
                <br>place pan back over medium-high heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Add spinach and cook, tossing with tongs until itâ€™s just barely wilted and bright green. 
                <br>Transfer into a strainer to cool. Squeeze out any excess water, and chop before using. 
                <br>Or, use scissors to snip into small pieces.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Whisk eggs with salt until yolks have been incorporated into the whites.  
                <br>Whisk in milk and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish with olive oil. 
                <br>Cover the bottom with a single tight layer of stale bread cubes. 
                <br>Top evenly with about 60% of sausage mixture, layer on 60% of spinach, and then scatter over half the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>Top this with another layer of bread cubes, pressing down lightly with your hands to flatten. 
                <br>Top bread with remaining sausage and spinach. Ladle egg and milk mixture evenly over casserole. 
                <br>Top with the remaining cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>Wrap tightly and place in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 10</h3>
            <p>Bake strata in the preheated oven until top is lightly browned, 
                <br>until an instant read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 150 degrees F (66 degrees C), 
                <br>about 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 11</h3>
            <p>Let strata rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
